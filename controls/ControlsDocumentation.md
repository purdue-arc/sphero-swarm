February 2024: Created inital programs to control Sphero using SpheroV2 API, sending basic preset intstructions (move, color change) to 1 Sphero

March 2024: Expanded intial control program to work with 3 spheros. However all commands must still be preprogrammed

April 2024: Refined and added new control functions to provide algorithms team more options (change directions, movement speed)

September 2024: Restructured program to allow move commands in terms of distance instead of timesteps, began work on a master-slave system for an algorithm to to send out specific commands to individual spheros

October 2024:
