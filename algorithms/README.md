## Simulation

# On VSCode 

Simply run file ```sphero-sim-w-grid.py```

# If Pygame is not installed

You may want to create a virtual environment:

``` python3 -m venv env ```

and activate it with 

``` source env/bin/activate ```

Then pip install python using 

```./env/bin/pip install pygame```

Finally, run the file in the virtual environment

```./env/bin/python sphero-sim-w-grid.py```

## Driver

```sphero_driver.py``` is the program used to control the actual spheros.
TODO: Documentation needed for using the driver
