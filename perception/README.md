# Perceptions
    *last updated 9/20/2025*

    Our subteam uses computer vision to track and ID sphero ball locations.
    If you're in this folder for the first time, I recommend setting up a virtual environment. 
    In windows, navigate to the perceptions/ folder in your terminal and run:

    `python -m venv venv`


    Now your virtual environment is set up. To activate it, do

    `venv/Scripts/activate`
    for mac:
    `source venv/bin/activate`

    and then install the requirements.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    then you can run any program, such as yolo_experimentation.py, by doing

    `python yolo_experimentation.py'


## 9/20/2025 update
    Perceptions is made up of mostly new members that weren't a part of the project
    for the first iterations of perceptions code. We will build off of their progress,
    but we are moving forward mainly using the **YOLO** package for computer vision
    instead of opencv.

    I'm moving older code to the 'old' folder.

    We are mainly working out of the yolo_test_v2.py file.
